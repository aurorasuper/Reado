# Reado
Reado is my first ever database project created as a lab in the course [Databbase technology and web based systems at Ume√• university](https://www.umu.se/utbildning/kurser/databasteknik-och-webbaserade-system/). It uses .NET core and SQL, with a self implemented data access layer. 

It is a reading list app that uses a book database, where users can log in and add books to their reading list. They can also give each book a score. The webapp has full CRUD functionality and users can add and delete books from their lists, whearas admins can add, delete, and update books from the database. The user can also edit and delete their profiles. It also has search, filter, and sorting features. 

The purpose of this lab was to get familiar with SQL and creating a data access layer. It is my first database project and security was therefore not taken into account, and neither was design. Because of this, the application is not live but feel free to look through the implementation. 

If you're interested in watching a demo clip or read the project report (both in swedish), [click here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gg7khpKQ_kZeaUcw37JgIwqjtkoup4fr?usp=sharing) to request access to google drive.
